    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Anastasia Bessonova is a Porto-based narrative designer and scriptwriter working across
      games and animation. She transitioned into game narrative design after more than a decade
      writing for animation, bringing a strong foundation in structure, dialogue, and
      character-driven storytelling into interactive media.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her work focuses on world-building and narrative systems that support player agency,
      with particular strength in dark fantasy, sci-fi, and comedy. She develops original lore,
      character arcs, and dialogue that align closely with art direction, gameplay goals,
      and production constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anastasia works as a proactive narrative lead, embedding with teams from early concept
      through to production. She translates high-level creative vision into shared narrative
      frameworks, supports cross-department collaboration, and ensures story remains coherent
      and purposeful throughout development.
