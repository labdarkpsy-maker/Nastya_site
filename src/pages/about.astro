    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Renato Moreira is a <strong>Lisbon-born, Porto-based</strong> multidisciplinary artist and
      technical operator whose work spans <strong>electronic music production, live performance,
      sound engineering and audiovisual systems</strong>. Active since 1998, his trajectory reflects
      a long-term engagement with sound not only as an artistic medium, but as a technical and
      structural system.
    </p>

    <p>
      His creative output is distributed across multiple musical identities –
      <strong>LAB, Bosmer, Unikorp and Kid Reaktion</strong> – each representing a distinct sonic
      direction rather than a branding exercise. These aliases allow different tempos, structures
      and aesthetics to coexist without dilution, while remaining rooted in a shared approach to
      sound design, rhythm and atmosphere.

      Renato’s first contact with music production came in the late 1990s, experimenting with early
      digital tools such as Rebirth, FL Studio, Cakewalk Sonar and Ableton Live, eventually settling
      on <strong>Cubase</strong> as his primary production environment. Over time, his work expanded
      across genres including darkpsy, forest, downtempo, dark progressive, drum and bass and
      half-tempo, always with a strong focus on system awareness, spatial detail and functional sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      From 2005 onward, live performance became a central part of his practice. He has performed full
      live sets across <strong>three continents and more than thirteen countries</strong>, appearing
      at major international festivals such as <strong>Ozora, Modem, Hadra, Freqs of Nature</strong>
      and <strong>Masters of Puppets</strong>. Alongside this, his music has been released through
      <strong>25 different labels</strong>, including a full-length album, multiple EPs, remix
      collections and curated compilations.

      In parallel with his artistic work, Renato developed a solid professional path in
      <strong>sound engineering and audiovisual production</strong>, working in environments that
      demand precision, reliability and rapid problem-solving. His technical experience includes
      <strong>international congresses, conferences, festivals and cultural events</strong>, where
      he operates across sound, AV, video and live systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than separating “artist” and “technician,” Renato operates at the intersection of both.
      His understanding of sound is informed equally by years of creative exploration and by
      hands-on technical responsibility in real-world production contexts.

      Today, Renato Moreira continues to develop new work across music, sound and audiovisual fields,
      maintaining a practice built on <strong>longevity, adaptability and a deep respect for the
      mechanics of sound</strong>.
