    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Anastasia Bessonova is a <strong>Porto-based narrative designer</strong> working across
      <strong>games and animation</strong>. Her focus is building story systems that support
      player agency, strong character voice, and clear production constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      She works from early concept through to implementation-ready content - aligning narrative with
      design goals, pacing, and gameplay loops, and collaborating closely with design, art, and audio.
