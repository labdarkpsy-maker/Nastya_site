      Music production education through long-term mentorship, workshops,
      and institutional teaching.

    <p>
      Teaching has been a core part of my practice for many years, with a strong
      focus on one-on-one mentorship. I work closely with artists to develop their
      sound, technical understanding, and creative direction, adapting the process
      to each individual rather than following rigid curricula.
    </p>

    <p>
      While mentorship is my preferred format, I also teach in group and
      institutional contexts, including workshops and structured classes,
      adapting the same principles to different learning environments.

    <h2>Teaching Approach</h2>

    <p>
      My approach emphasizes fundamentals over shortcuts, sound design literacy,
      critical listening, and long-term artistic growth. The goal is not only to
      complete tracks, but to build understanding, confidence, and autonomy
      in each artist’s creative process.
