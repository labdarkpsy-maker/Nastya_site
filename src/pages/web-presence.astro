    <h2>What I build</h2>
    <p>
      I build small websites that make you look legitimate and make it easy for people to contact you.
      No complex systems, no endless revisions - just a clean site that does the job.

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>One-page business websites</li>
      <li>Portfolio sites for artists and freelancers</li>
      <li>Small company pages (2-5 pages)</li>
      <li>WhatsApp, phone, email, maps - clear and direct calls to action</li>
      <li>Fast load times and mobile-first layout</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="section text">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Short intake - what you do, what you offer, how people contact you</li>
      <li>I build the first version</li>
      <li>One revision round to polish text and details</li>
      <li>Launch and shareable link</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      If you already have photos and text, it goes faster. If you don’t, I can help you organize it.
