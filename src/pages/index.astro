      <p>
        Narrative designer and scriptwriter with a background in animation and over three years
        in game development. I specialise in world-building and character-driven storytelling
        across dark fantasy, sci-fi, action, and comedy.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work bridges traditional narrative craft and interactive design, creating coherent
        story systems that support gameplay, tone, and player experience.
