    <h1>Process</h1>

    <p>
      My narrative design process is grounded in research, collaboration, and
      production awareness. I work closely with teams from early concept through
      implementation, ensuring story supports both creative vision and practical
      constraints.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>1) Research & discovery</h2>

    <p>
      I begin with deep research tailored to the project’s needs — from consulting
      subject-matter experts for sci-fi worlds to analysing audience psychology for
      children’s or comedy-driven content.
    </p>

    <p>
      This phase clarifies goals, tone, constraints, references, and the role
      narrative will play within gameplay, art direction, and overall production.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>2) Narrative structure & blueprints</h2>

    <p>
      I translate research and creative vision into clear narrative structures:
      world rules, story pillars, character arcs, and high-level plot progression.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage, I often create <em>narrative blueprints</em> — mapping emotional
      arcs alongside plot beats and gameplay moments to ensure story and player
      experience evolve together.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>3) Writing & voice</h2>

    <p>
      With structure in place, I write dialogue, character barks, quest text,
      cutscenes, and scripts with a strong focus on voice, tone consistency,
      and character motivation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing is always informed by implementation realities, localisation needs,
      and iteration cycles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>4) Implementation & collaboration</h2>

    <p>
      I work closely with design and engineering to translate narrative into
      engine-ready content — using tools, variables, conditions, and flags where
      required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clear documentation and communication ensure narrative systems remain
      understandable and adaptable throughout development.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>5) Iteration & polish</h2>

    <p>
      Narrative work continues through playtests, feedback loops, and polish
      passes. I refine pacing, clarity, and emotional impact based on real player
      experience and team feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is always a coherent, purposeful narrative that feels integrated —
      not layered on top.
