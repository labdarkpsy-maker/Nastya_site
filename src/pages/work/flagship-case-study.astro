    <h1>Flagship case study</h1>

    <p class="muted">
      Representative work - details are anonymised and project-agnostic. This is a transparent description of how I
      approach narrative design, what I produce, and how I collaborate with teams.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      My work spans game narrative design and animation scriptwriting. In games, I specialise in world-building,
      character-driven storytelling, and dialogue across dark fantasy, sci-fi, action, and comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In production, I embed with teams from concept to completion, translating high-level vision into a shared narrative
      framework that supports art direction, gameplay goals, and constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>The narrative problem</h2>
    <p>
      Create a coherent narrative foundation that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defines world rules, tone, and lore in a way the whole team can use</li>
      <li>Builds characters with clear motivations and consistent voice</li>
      <li>Supports gameplay pacing and player experience - not just “story on top”</li>
      <li>Remains implementable and maintainable during iteration</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Production reality: changing scope, timelines, and iterative design</li>
      <li>Cross-department alignment: narrative must serve design and art (and vice versa)</li>
      <li>Implementation needs: tools, variables/flags, branching logic when applicable</li>
      <li>Audience and tone: genre expectations (dark fantasy/sci-fi/comedy) and platform needs</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <h3>1) Research-first discovery</h3>
    <p>
      I begin with deep research tailored to the project: consulting subject-matter experts for sci-fi plausibility,
      or analysing audience psychology for children’s or comedy-driven content. This prevents shallow world-building
      and gives the team a shared foundation.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Narrative structure + “blueprints”</h3>
    <p>
      I build narrative structures (pillars, arcs, plot architecture, quest framing) and create <em>narrative blueprints</em>
      that map emotional arcs alongside plot beats and gameplay moments. This keeps story and player experience aligned.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Character voice + dialogue systems</h3>
    <p>
      I write character-specific, tone-aware dialogue that reveals personality and advances the plot. When interactivity is
      involved, I design choice-based structures that remain readable and production-friendly.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Production-aware implementation</h3>
    <p>
      I support implementation by delivering clear documentation and content handoff that works with team tools
      (Docs/Notion/Miro) and pipelines (Trello/Jira). I have a basic understanding of Unity integration and adapt quickly
      to project tooling.
    </p>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the project, deliverables may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>World bible: rules, factions, history, tone references</li>
      <li>Character bibles: motivations, arcs, relationships, voice notes</li>
      <li>Beat sheets and plot architecture</li>
      <li>Quest outlines and narrative flow</li>
      <li>Dialogue scripts, barks, VO notes, and localisation-friendly writing</li>
      <li>Branching maps and choice logic (for interactive stories)</li>
      <li>Editing and script doctoring for clarity and consistency</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The goal is a narrative foundation the team can actually build on: coherent, implementable, and resilient to
      iteration. Story becomes a shared framework rather than a separate document - supporting tone, pacing, and player experience.
