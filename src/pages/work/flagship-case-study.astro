    <h1>Flagship case study</h1>

    <p class="muted">
      Representative, anonymised case study. Describes my working approach, decision-making,
      and deliverables across game narrative projects.

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      I work across game narrative design and animation, specialising in world-building,
      character-driven storytelling, and dialogue for dark fantasy, sci-fi, and comedy projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In production, I embed with teams from concept through implementation, translating
      high-level vision into a shared narrative framework that supports design and art.
    </p>

    <h2>Narrative problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a clear, usable narrative foundation for the whole team</li>
      <li>Define world rules, tone, and character motivation early</li>
      <li>Ensure story supports gameplay pacing and player experience</li>
      <li>Keep narrative implementable under iteration and scope change</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section block reading flow">
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Iterative production and evolving design</li>
      <li>Cross-discipline alignment (narrative, design, art, engineering)</li>
      <li>Tooling and implementation limitations</li>
      <li>Genre expectations and audience needs</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <p>
      I begin with focused research tailored to the project: subject-matter consultation
      for sci-fi plausibility, or audience analysis for tone and accessibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this, I build narrative structures and <em>narrative blueprints</em> that map
      emotional arcs alongside plot beats and gameplay moments, keeping story and player
      experience aligned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing follows structure: character voice, dialogue, and branching are developed
      with localisation, tooling, and iteration in mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      I collaborate closely with design and engineering to deliver engine-ready content
      supported by clear documentation and handoff.
    </p>

      <li>World and lore bibles</li>
      <li>Character profiles and voice guidelines</li
